# Private Chat Application

This is a simple private chat application built in Python, demonstrating basic networking, logging and multithreading.

## Use Cases

This chat application can be used in various scenarios, including:
- **Local network communication**: Ideal for small-scale, local network chat applications where simplicity and quick setup are key.
- **Educational purposes**: Useful for learning about socket programming, multithreading, and basic client-server architecture in Python.
- **Prototype for custom chat applications**: Can be extended and customized to fit specific needs or integrated into larger projects.

## How to Use

1. **Save the Python script**: Save the provided Python code as `chat_app.py`.

2. **Install dependencies**: Ensure you have the `colorama` module installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install colorama
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   - To host a chat server, run:
     ```bash
     python chat_app.py
     ```
     and select option `1` to host.

   - To connect to a chat server, run:
     ```bash
     python chat_app.py
     ```
     and select option `2` to connect.

4. **Interact**: Use the terminal to send and receive messages. Type messages and press Enter to send. Type `bye`, `close`, or `exit` to close the connection.

## Conclusion

This simple chat application provides a foundational understanding of socket programming and multithreading in Python. It can be further developed into a more robust and feature-rich application as needed.
